# Spotify URI Handler

![alt text](spotifyurihandler.png "Logo")

This project builds a Windows installer (.exe and .msi) for 64bit versions of Windows.

It will install a URI handler (links that start with "spotify:") and open them in your default browser.

Please note that this may conflict with the Spotify desktop client, do not install both!


## Sample URI:

album: <spotify:album:27ftYHLeunzcSzb33Wk1hf>

artist: <spotify:artist:3mvkWMe6swnknwscwvGCHO>

track: <spotify:track:7lEptt4wbM0yJTvSG5EBof>

user: <spotify:user:1185903410>

playlist: <spotify:user:1185903410:playlist:6YAnJeVC7tgOiocOG23Dd>
